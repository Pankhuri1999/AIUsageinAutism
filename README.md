The data used in the motion therapy and speech therapy experiments cannot be made publicly available because they consist of the authors’ own motion recordings, hand gestures, and facial expressions, which are personal and potentially identifiable.

In contrast, the data captured for participant responses in the context interpretation experiment and the emotion recognition therapy are provided as anonymized CSV files.

Each folder in the project repository contains a dedicated Jupyter Notebook corresponding to its respective experiment. Sample CSV files for the context interpretation and emotion recognition experiments are included within their respective folders to support reproducibility and methodological transparency.
